This is a JavaScript/PHP AJAX tool I created to plot our healthcare providers on a Google map. The providers were geocoded offline and put into a MySQL database to be queried through an AJAX endpoint. The code is split into a JS object for the client-side component and a PHP class for the server-side component; please see [ppn.js](js/ppn.js) and [ppn.php](php/ppn.php) respectively. My CSS work matched a PSD from the design department.


The production site is restricted by cookie so I put a version on my website with some dummy data: http://superawesome.biz/ppn/?dist=5&city=rio+de+janeiro
